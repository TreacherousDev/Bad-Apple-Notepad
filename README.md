# Bad Apple in Notepad
"But can it play Bad Apple?" Yes, yes it can.
 
## Installation
Install the windows executable [here](https://github.com/TreacherousDev/Bad-Apple-Notepad/releases).  
If you are more risk averse, it is recommended that you compile it yourself using the steps below.


## Building from Source
1. Clone the repo
2. Install vcpkg and configure it as a system variable
3. Run `vcpkg install opencv`  in the terminal
4. Build solution and play
   
The compiled binary and libraries will be located in the `x64/Debug` folder. Pack it as a zip or use [Inno Setup Compiler](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) to build a setup wizard.
