 shitposting because i can

Install the windows exe [here](https://github.com/TreacherousDev/Bad-Apple-Notepad/releases)

or compile it directly from source by cloning the repo and running it in visual studio
you need to install opencv beforehand, you can use a package installer like vcpkg and run `vcpkg install opencv` in command prompt
